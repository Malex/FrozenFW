Templates are the most useful (and the only reason for I developed
it) feature.

You should set your basic template in your frozenrc, and set
different templates by using the classmethod Output.set_template

Templates file should be xhtml1.1 standard compliant, even though
the framework don't check it (it's only a suggestion).

In template you can put everything you want, thinking that the string
will be formatted via str.format method. So you can use what format
syntax allow you (putting {} or {n} where n is a integer number, will
be replaced with the indicated non-keyword arg printed).
For keyword arguments, put {kw}, where kw is the name of your printed
var (via print(kw=something) ).
Another feature is looping: you can write something like this:
@!loop#my_list(this is one of my list element: {my_list})
The iterable written after the # will be looped, and all occurences
of the same name in ( ) content will be replaced with the element of
the iterable.
