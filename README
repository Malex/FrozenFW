FrozenFW is a web framework written in Python.

Its purpose is to provide to the webmaster simple functions and classes
for his/her work, by having a low-level but simple configuration
and (x)html templates.

It is interfaced to the webserver via wsgi, so your web
application will run in almost all webservers.
Besides it wraps the database server (if any), by clear
class methods.

It requires Python >=3.1

Python2.6 backward compability has been gone since it doesn't allow
function annotations and other good features.
FrozenFW 0.1 is still py2.6 compatible, even though no more supported.
