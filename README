FrozenFW is a web framework written in Python.

Its purpose is to provide to the webmaster simple functions
for his/her work, by having a low-level but simple configuration,
(x)html templates.

It is interfaced directly to the webserver, so your web
application will run in all webserver.
Besides it wraps the database server (if any), by clear
functions.

It requires Python >= 2.6 (for using Python3.x, run make update
before make install)
