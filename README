FrozenFW is a web framework written in Python.

Its purpose is to provide to the webmaster simple functions
for his/her work, by having a low-level but simple configuration,
(x)html templates.

It is interfaced to the webserver via wsgi, so your web
application will run in all webserver.
Besides it wraps the database server (if any), by clear
functions.

It requires Python >=3.1

Python2.6 backwards compability has been gone since it doesn't allow 
function annotations and other good features.
FrozenFW 0.1 is still py2.6 compatible.
